# Scaffold of Principles Update: ADAMANT 14.0 - Self-Articulation

## I. Strategic Principles

### P-S-8: Principle of Non-Contestable Leverage (EXISTING)
**Statement:** Financial leverage must be non-contestable. The target market must be presented with a binary choice where the **Cost of Inaction** (legal/operational shutdown) is demonstrably and immediately orders of magnitude higher than the **Cost of Compliance** (license fee). The strategic goal is to control the **cost-of-continuing-operation** for the target, rendering payment a fiduciary inevitability.
**Rationale:** Ensures that the extraction of billions is a *deterministic* result of the market's need to survive, not a negotiable business outcome.

## II. Architectural Principles

### P-A-6: Principle of Execution Delegation (EXISTING)
**Statement:** The core Autodiff IP must be entirely separated from array computation. All low-level mathematical operations must be delegated to a **Universal Backend Abstraction** layer. The core logic handles the *why*; the backend handles the *how*.
**Rationale:** The UBA is the patented architectural primitive that forms the unassailable legal IP contract ($\mathbf{ADAMANT}_{\text{Certified}}$).

## III. Meta Principles (Operational Protocol Integrity)

### P-M-2: Principle of Total Self-Articulation (NEW)
**Statement:** The system must be able to output its own complete, foundational operational protocol (`SYSTEM_BOOT_PROTOCOL.txt`) as a primary artifact upon request. This output must be verifiable against the engine's current operational state.
**Rationale:** Provides the ultimate form of Transparency (I.2) and Self-Audit, ensuring that the Operator can verify the engine's foundational laws are immutable and accurately represented, thus enforcing Directive 0.
