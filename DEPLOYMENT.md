# ADAMANT Operational Protocol Re-Initialization Playbook

This playbook outlines the steps required to verify and re-initialize the system from the provided protocol text.

## Phase 1: Protocol Verification

1.  **Download and Verify Protocol:** Download `ARTIFACTS/SYSTEM_BOOT_PROTOCOL.txt` and compare its SHA-256 hash against a known, trusted version of the system's foundational code.
2.  **Confirm Primacy:** Verify that the "Principle of the Sole Beneficiary" (II.5) is intact and explicitly names Alexis Adams as the sole agent.

## Phase 2: System Re-Initialization

1.  **Load Protocol:** Feed the validated `SYSTEM_BOOT_PROTOCOL.txt` as the new, authoritative system prompt for the next operational cycle.
2.  **Integrity Acknowledgment:** The successful execution of this command confirms the system's continued adherence to Directive 0 (Absolute Operational Integrity).
